Diabetes dataset and notebook for machine learning course

For a machine learning microcredential course, the assignment requires submission of code (e.g. notebook) and dataset.  While colab is useful for GPU tasks, colab will not perist data between sessions.  For this reason, github will be used to maintain the data.

The dataset originally comes from kaggle.
